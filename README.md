# Yet another Chip 8 interpreter using Rust

## How to?

Install sdl2 with sdl2 gfx. Then build it using ```cargo build```. Then run like this: ```cargo run YOUR_CHIP8_GAME_HERE```.
I've included some games here. You can run one like this: ```cargo run games/INVADERS```

## Acknowledgements

I'm a huge noob. And this is my first time. I copied codes cartridge, display, input from <https://github.com/starrhorne/chip8-rust>
